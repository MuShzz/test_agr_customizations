-- Description: Item location mapping from nav to adi format
--
-- 09.10.2024.TO    Created
-- 14.02.2025.BF	Applied temporary fix to the view to reduce the items listed, since we are doing filtering on nav.item
--					endpoints to exclude certain items, joining on that table to only include items listed in anv.item and not all in stockkeepingunits
-- 07.03.2025.BF	added filtering instead on nav.v_item since that can be reduced even more based on settings like exclude closed items
-- 10.06.2025.RDG	Changed primary_vendor_no to null to use the default vendor from nav.items
