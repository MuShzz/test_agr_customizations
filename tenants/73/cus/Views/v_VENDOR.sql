            CAST(Cardcode AS NVARCHAR(255)) AS [NO],
            CAST(CardCode + ISNULL(' - ' + CardName,'') AS NVARCHAR(255)) AS [NAME],
            CAST(1 AS SMALLINT) AS [LEAD_TIME_DAYS],

        FROM
			[cus].OCRD
		WHERE
			CardType = 'S' -- 'S' means supplier so we only want to filter on them (also have customers in this table)
